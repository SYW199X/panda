				<p class="title">About Us</p>
				<p>The Chinese <span>People's Liberation Army (PLA)</span> is the armed forces of the 
				People's Republic of China. It is comprised of five service branches; the Ground Force, Navy,
				Air Force, Rocket Force, and Strategic Support Force, and totals two million active
				personnel. In recent decades, the PLA has seen tremendous modernisation and has 
				enjoyed a vast increase in combat potential despite being more than halved in size
				from over four million since 1980.</p>
				<p>The immense changes to the PLA has multiple implications. One, the world is increasingly 
				curious	about the PLA as power begets attention, and the PLA and the China as a whole is becoming
				more powerful. Two, the PLA is changing rapidly and the few who could be bothered to put in the 
				effort to understand the PLA in the first place quickly find their hard-earned understanding 
				outdated. Three, owing to point one, many are finding out how difficult it is to get accurate 
				information about the PLA due to the language barrier and the PLA's inherent opaqueness. These 
				factors coalesce into sufficient cause for the establishment of this website which aims to
				provide accessible and comprehensible up-to-date information about the PLA.</p>
				<p>This website was and is built, populated, and maintained by volunteers. If you would like to
