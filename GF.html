				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>The PLA Ground Force is the oldest and largest service branch of the PLA. It is also the third largest ground army in the world after the Indian and North Korean armies with just under a million active personnel. Despite its impressive size, the PLAGF has actually shrunk massively in recent years and the PRC had never had a ground force with fewer than a million personnel until 2017 when around 600,000 personnel were either demobilised or transferred to other branches. The voluminous reductions in manpower freed up significant funding for procurement and force buildup which is allowing the PLA to achieve a rather healthy mechanisation ratio of around 70%.</p>

				<p>The PLAGF's equipment today can on average be described as legacy. However, there exists a large critical mass of modern equipment that dwarves the total size of most militaries in the world. In essence, even if the PLA cherrypicks only their modern units, that force will still outsize the majority of opponents they could face. A sizeable chunk of obsolete equipment remains in circulation but production of new vehicles is quite healthy and the limited numbers of very old designs are expected to disappear within a couple years.</p>

				<P>The PLAGF in the present day is a force generally geared towards large-scale high-intensity conflict (HIC). However, it leverages modern communications and data-processing to revamp its approach to large-scale HIC, introducing numerous changes to the established post-WW2  combined-arms approach to warfare. A large component of this revamping involves pushing support assets down to lower echelons and having smaller integrated formations in general. This manifests in the post-2017 reform where divisions were split and consolidated into brigades, and battalions made into combined-arms battalions. This hugely improved the PLAGF's reaction speeds and flexibility, allowing them to do more with less, albeit at the cost of placing much greater demands on lower-echelon officer and NCO competencies which is being addressed by an expanded and reworked training and education pipeline.</P>

				<p>The organisation hierachy for the PLAGF manoeuvre forces is roughly as follows: Theatre Command -> Group Army -> Brigade -> Battalion. The current battalion is the smallest integrated fighting element of the PLAGF manoeuvre force and is the lowest echelon that possesses a staff and support assets allowing it to sustain combat operations independent of higher-echelon support. A PLA brigade is roughly analogous in size and role to a US BCT. The group army is an operational formation about the size of a corps, possessing 50-60 thousand personnel. In addition to manoeuvre line formations, the PLAGF also relies heavily on support brigades such as artillery and EW to fully flesh out the warfighting ecosystem.</p>
