			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>The PLA Ground Force is the oldest and largest service branch of the PLA. It is also the second largest ground army in the world with just under a million active personnel. Despite its impressive size, the PLAGF has actually shrunk massively in recent years and the PRC had never had a ground force with fewer than a million men until 2017. The voluminous reductions in manpower freed up significant funding for procurement and force buildup which is allowing the PLA to achieve a rather healthy degree of mechanisation of around 70%.</p>

			<p>The PLA's equipment today can be described on average as legacy. However, there exists a large critical mass of modern equipment that dwarves the total size of most militaries, both premiere and backwater, in the world. In essence, even if the PLA cherrypicks just the modern units, that force will still be larger than the majority of opponents they could face. There does remain a sizeable chunk of obsolete equipment but production of new vehicles is quite healthy and the limited numbers of antiquated vehicles are expected to disappear within a couple years.</p>
