				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>The Chinese <span>People's Liberation Army (PLA)</span> is the armed forces of the 
				People's Republic of China. It is comprised of five service branches; the Ground Force, Navy,
				Air Force, Rocket Force, and Strategic Support Force, and totals two million active
				personnel. In recent decades, the PLA has seen tremendous modernisation and professionalisation and has enjoyed a vast increase in combat potential.</p>

				<p>The PLA Ground Force is the oldest and largest service branch of the PLA. It is also the third largest ground army in the world after the Indian and North Korean armies with just under a million active personnel. Despite its impressive size, the PLAGF has actually shrunk massively in recent years and the PRC had never had a ground force with fewer than a million personnel until 2017. The voluminous reductions in manpower freed up significant funding for procurement and force buildup which is allowing the PLA to achieve a rather healthy mechanisation ratio of around 70%.</p>

				<p>The PLA's equipment today can on average be described as legacy. However, there exists a large critical mass of modern equipment that dwarves the total size of most militaries in the world. In essence, even if the PLA cherrypicks only their modern units, that force will still be larger than the majority of opponents they could face. There does remain a sizeable chunk of obsolete equipment but production of new vehicles is quite healthy and the limited numbers of very old designs are expected to disappear within a couple years.</p>

				<p>The basic combat formation of the PLAGF are the corps-sized Group Armies (GA) which command a series of brigades both manoeuvre and support. These formations are also supported by higher-echelon-subordinate specialist brigades that provide strategic reconnaissance, signals, combat engineering, and electronic warfare capabilities among others. GAs are assigned to a theatre command which are geo-strategic partitions that specialise in planning and training against threats in their specific axis. For example, the Eastern Theatre Command specialises in the Taiwan contingency as well as potential confrontations with Japan and USPACOM. During peacetime, the thirteen GAs are distributed quite evenly across the five theatre commands but can be concentrated flexibly during wartime.</p>
